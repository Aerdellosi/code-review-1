        <h3>The Reflecting Pool</h3>
        <p>
          tl;dr: A forum where users can discuss original insights (o.I.0 --
          original insights only) within the format of:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A brief anecdote of how the insight was derived.</li>
          <li>The insight put into a standard-form argument.</li>
          <li>
            A detailed list of collected evidence both in support of and against
            the posited argument.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Other users will discuss the validity and soundness of the argument in
          the comments section below.
        </p>
        <p>Other sub-forums will include topic such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Journaling</strong></li>

        <p>
          As well as two meta sections: Ban Appeals, and
          <strong>'the Mollusk Trench'</strong>, a place which acts as a general

          Longer description:<br /><br />In the dusty alleyways of ancient
          Athens a cobbler stoops over a boiling cauldron in his steamy shop,
          softening the leather for his sandals. A girl comes in, about the age
          of seven, and walks up to the cobbler. He pretends not to notice. She
          pulls at the edge of his peplos, and he motions to the rack by the
          door. She nods, pulls out two drachms, and hands it the cobbler. As
          the cobbler turns around and reaches for the coins, he pauses. Insight
          flashes in his mind. He smiles broadly, grabs the coins, escorts the
          girl out the door, finishes his boil, places his leather out to mold,
          closes his shop and then hikes to the Agora. It's at the agora that
          he'll discuss his ideas with the city's philosophers and evaluate them
          through dialectic for their validity and soundness.<br /><br />This
          process is often mirrored in online discourse; someone moves through
          their life, thinks of something interesting, and then shares it on
          social media with the intent of allowing their network to evaluate
          it....But the user runs into a problem: In virtually all serious or
          semi-serious discourse online, other users will dismiss their argument
          outright unless either a piece of it or its entirety originates from
          someone who's established themselves as having intellectual clout,
          either an expert, or a philosopher; instead of tweeting about how
          important it is to plant hardwood trees, the user has to cite Marcus
          Aurelius saying the exact same thing.<br /><br /><em
            >In other words, unless a man in the 21st century cites a man from
            two thousand years ago, his argument gets ignored irrespective of
            its value.</em
          ><br /><br />Under the premise that 'if it truly
          <span class="italic">is</span> timeless, timeless wisdom will
          resurface given enough time', the
          <strong
            >Reflecting Pool offers an explicitly structured platform of
            discourse where users can explore both their o.I.0 arguments as well
            as their methods and techniques of derivation similar to the Agora
            of ancient of Athens.</strong

        <p>Languages used: as of right now I'm not sure. If I use machine learning for the Golden Age search algorithm, that could be a gateway into learning how to use diffusion on a deeper level, but we'll see.</p>
