                  Longer description:<br /><br />In the dusty alleyways of ancient
                  Athens a cobbler stoops over a boiling cauldron in his steamy shop,
                  softening the leather for his sandals. A girl comes in, about the age
                  of seven, and walks up to the cobbler. He pretends not to notice. She
                  pulls at the edge of his peplos, and he motions to the rack by the
                  door. She nods, pulls out two drachms, and hands it the cobbler. As
                  the cobbler turns around and reaches for the coins, he pauses. Insight
                  flashes in his mind. He smiles broadly, grabs the coins, escorts the
                  girl out the door, finishes his boil, places his leather out to mold,
                  closes his shop and then hikes to the Agora. It's at the agora that
                  he'll discuss his ideas with the city's philosophers and evaluate them
                  through dialectic for their validity and soundness.<br /><br />This
                  process is often mirrored in online discourse; someone moves through
                  their life, thinks of something interesting, and then shares it on
                  social media with the intent of allowing their network to evaluate
                  it....But the user runs into a problem: In virtually all serious or
                  semi-serious discourse online, other users will dismiss their argument
                  outright unless either a piece of it or its entirety originates from
                  someone who's established themselves as having intellectual clout,
                  either an expert, or a philosopher; instead of tweeting about how
                  important it is to plant hardwood trees, the user has to cite Marcus
                  Aurelius saying the exact same thing.<br /><br /><em
                    >In other words, unless a man in the 21st century cites a man from
                    two thousand years ago, his argument gets ignored irrespective of
                    its value.</em
                  ><br /><br />Under the premise that 'if it truly
                  <span class="italic">is</span> timeless, timeless wisdom will

                    of ancient of Athens.</strong
