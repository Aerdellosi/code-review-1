          Longer description:<br />In the dusty alleyways of ancient Athens a
          cobbler stoops over a vat in his shop, steaming the leather for his
          sandals. A girl comes in, about the age of seven, and walks up to the
          cobbler. He pretends not to notice. She pulls at the edge of his
          peplos, and he motions to the rack by the door. She nods, pulls out
          two drachms, and hands it the cobbler. As the cobbler turns around and
          reaches for the coins, he pauses. Insight flashes in his mind. He
          smiles broadly, grabs the coins, escorts the girl out the door,
          finishes his boil, places his leather out to mold, closes his shop and
          then hikes to the Agora. It's at the agora that he'll discuss his
          ideas with the city's philosophers and evaluate them, through
          dialectic, for their validity and soundness.<br />This process is
          often mirrored in online discourse. Someone moves through their life,
          thinks of something interesting, and then goes to share it on a social
          platform.
