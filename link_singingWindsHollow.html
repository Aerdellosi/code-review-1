          >Singing Winds Hollow</span
        ><br />A book I plan to write.<br /><br />
        Yamanoue Akiri earned the moniker 'the fox of Nobunaga' through his
        cunning and audacity during the final chapters of the Sengoku Jidai.
        After the death of his master, the fox swore fealty to Toyotomi
        Hideyoshi, but the paranoid warlord had Akiri jailed, tortured,
        questioned, and slated for seppuku. Through mysterious circumstances
        Akiri was pardoned, but as an insult to his honor he was given the post
        of hunter of the remaining Ikko Ikki -- mercenary monks who'd fled to
        the far North of Japan after their war with the Oda clan.
        <br />

        Setting out with an army of five hundred ragtag soldiers, Akiri stalked
        his prey with dignity. After several successful missions, Akiri found
        himself in the village of Saigo No Yukibana, the Last Snowflower, where
        a small force of Ikko Ikki had taken to the caves in the nearby Hakkoda
        range. Ignoring the warnings of the beleagured villagers, the fox lead
        his army into an ambush due to false intelligence, and discovered, to
        his horror, the stories told by the villagers were true: the starving
        Ikko Ikki had sworn fealty to the Oni of Singing Winds Hollow, and under
        the guidance of their new leader, Akiri's soldiers were massacred.
        Bloodied and scattered, the fox and his remaining forces returned to
        Saigo No Yukibana to lick their wounds and hatch a desperate plot to
        recover the legendary weapon
        <span class="italic">The Smile of Ameterasu</span> -- an object lost to
        time in the lowest chamber of the Oni's cave -- and end the murderous
        Ikko Ikki order once and for all.
