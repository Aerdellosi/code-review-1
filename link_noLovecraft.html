        Project Description: <br /><br />
        A text-only 'folk philosophy' forum whose primary subforum will be
        O.I.O., or 'original insights only'. 'Original' is defined here as any
        idea whose origin and primary argumentation is derived entirely outside
        of external sources from the ideator, and an OIO post will be comprised
        of four discrete sections: 1) A short explanation of the inspiration for
        the idea or insight, 2) The original argument given in standard form
        conceretely explaining the idea and the implications of that idea, 3)
        all gathered evidence both for/against/contextualizing the above
        argument (this will be given under the assumption that if the author
        doesn't due his due diligence, his ideas will be exhaustively taken
        apart in the comments), and 4), a new, standard form argument remade in
        the context of the above evidence.
        <br /><br />
        Note that OIO is no way attempting to be empirical. It is a methodology
        designed to give the average man a formal platform to reason for
        himself, and where other users of the forum will hold him accountable
        for presenting a well-thought out and organized critique of his own
        argument, research and logic. This format will be strictly enforced by
        moderators, and OIO is the only subsection of the forum where a standard
        of both rigor and form will be expected.
        <br /><br />
        Supplementing OIO will be a plethora of subforums with general topics
        such as: Meditation, Journaling, Lucid Dreaming, Dream Journaling,
        Nutrition, Exercise, Martial Arts, Sleep Optimization, Physical
        Exploration, Altered States of Consciousness, and others, all of which
        are centered around a praxis of "awareness"-- in this context, awareness
        can be defined alongside its more well known counterpart, 'mindfulness';
        mindfulness is the conscious experience of becoming aware of one's own
        discrete sensations of thought, emotion and the self, while 'awareness'
        is a set that contains mindfulness and is the conscious experience of
        becoming aware of one's internal states, as well as the internal states
        of others and patterns of behavior in the external world. Awarness is
        Neo seeing the machine code. Awareness is the precursor to wisdom, and
        awareness is what Socrates refers to when he says 'the unexamined life
        is not worth living'. In these subforums users will be able to post
        anything they want so long as its topical to the subforum it's posted
        in.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, there will be four meta-sections of the forum: Ban appeals,
        user suggestions, the Mollusk Trench (a text-only general discussion
        area with no rules other than basic internet etiquette-- i.e., no calls
        to violence, etc.), and the Agora, which will be explained below.
        <br /><br />
        There are two other aspects of this forum that make it unique: 1)
        Lineage Belts, and 2) an annually published collection of essays called
        'Back into the Cave Vol. n++' published through my subsidiary Predryas
        Publishing. The latter will be comprised of essays written by users
        whose posts have been voted as 'most insightful' during an end of year
        review. Selected users will be given the option to rewrite their post
        into a formal essay with the intention of incorporating both their own
        retrospectives as well as any discussion in the comment section that the
        writer deems worthwhile. <br /><br />
        Lineage Belts, the former, are social engagement Macguffins. A 'belt' is
        simply an object that a user can 'build' by completing certain
        achievement, for example, posting once per week for six months. Once
        these achievements have been completed the belt is built, and the user
        can either keep the belt (nothing happens) and optionally display it on
        their profiles, gift the belt (gifting can happen at any time) or sell
        the belt in a digital marketplace called 'the Agora' (can also happen at
        any time). A belt's history will always be kept and cannot be erased,
        including who had it, for how long, and whether or not it was given or
        sold when/if it changes owners. Lineage belts solve three problems: how
        to encourage frequent posters to keep posting by potential monetary
        rewards (i.e., another user enjoys reading their philosophy, and so
        decides to purchase one of their belts to support them), how to make
        older users engage with newer users in a healthy manner (i.e., an older
        user gifting a newer user a belt to encourage them to keep posting), and
        how to encourage well-known internet personalities and influencers to
        join the forum (as they now have a profit mechanism). In the extreme
        case of older users mentoring new users, Lineage Belts that are
        exclusively given can become tokens of actual philosophical lineages as
        multiples schools of thought can develop across the forum. A lineage
        belt that has only been given between users, and specifically, between
        known and respected users, will give the reciever a sense of duty and
        responsibility to keep posting high quality thought, and the longer a
        belt goes without being sold, the more it will be worth on the
        marketplace.
        <br /><br />
        PROFIT MODEL:
        <br /><br />
        Books published by Predryas will be sold for profit. Each user who
        volunteers their essay for the annual volume will be given 3-5% of net
        profits depending on how many users are featured in the volume. 10% of
        the profit generated through the sale of lineage belts will be exacted
        by Cloud in Head Studios, the website publisher, another subsidiary.
        Users can sign up for free, however there will be a 'premium' option for
        $5/month that will remove ads from the site. Ads will be delivered via
        Google adsense in both skyscraper and inline form, although inline ads
        will be sparse, as too many will quickly drive users away from the site.
